We conclude that deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have the potential to improve prostate cancer detection on multiparametric MR images (mpMRI). We demonstrated that our proposed DCNN-based prostate CAD ($CAD_{DL}$) is capable of learning lesion discriminating features from the given mpMR images. $CAD_{DL}$ further achieved promising results when compared to a published prostate CAD and showed potential for clinical application. In the future, we hope to develop a CAD that has many more applications in addition to tumor detection such as severity and tumor size prediction.
