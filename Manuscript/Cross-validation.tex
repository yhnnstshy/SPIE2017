The patient cohort was divided equally into two sets which were used for training or testing depending on the fold. Due to the limited number of patients in the study cohort, a validation-set was left out of the experimental setup. Instead, the CAD was evaluated on the test-set at multiple learning stages to characterize its performance over multiple epochs.
