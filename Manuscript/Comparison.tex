The performance of our $CAD_{DL}$ was compared to the published competing $CAD_{SVM}$ by Ref. \citenum{kwak2015automated}. $CAD_{SVM}$ uses local binary pattern features extracted from T2WI and B2000 images as features to an SVM classifier. In contrast to $CAD_{DL}$, which was trained on a relatively small number of tumor contour segmentations, biopsy point examples from 108 patients were used to train $CAD_{SVM}$. The testing-sets from $CAD_{DL}$ were used to compute curves and generate images for $CAD_{SVM}$.
