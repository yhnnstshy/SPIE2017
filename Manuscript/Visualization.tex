Insight Segmentation and Registration ToolKit (ITK) was used to render color probability maps for the CADs along with prostate and central gland outlines. Thresholds for rendering the images were determined from the ROC curves. A false-positive rate of 20\% was chosen as the operating point and used to select a threshold probability. The raw and ground-truth images were generated using a MATLAB script.
